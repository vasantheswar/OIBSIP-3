1. Data Collection:
Collect a labeled dataset of emails, where each email is labeled as spam or non-spam. You can find datasets for spam detection online or create your own.
2. Data Preprocessing:
Clean and preprocess the text data. This may include removing HTML tags, converting all text to lowercase, removing stop words, and stemming or lemmatization.
3. Feature Extraction:
Convert the text data into numerical features. Common techniques include using Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency), or word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe.
4. Splitting the Dataset:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the machine learning model, and the testing set is used to evaluate its performance.
5. Model Selection:
Choose a machine learning algorithm suitable for text classification. Common choices include Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
6. Model Training:
Train the selected model using the training dataset. The model learns to distinguish between spam and non-spam based on the features extracted from the email text.
7. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
8. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Optimize the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance. Grid search or random search can be used for this.
9. Testing with New Data:
Once satisfied with the model's performance, you can test it with new, unseen emails to see how well it generalizes to real-world scenarios.
